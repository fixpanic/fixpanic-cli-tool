- ✅ All agent management commands
- ✅ Configuration management system
- ✅ Platform detection and compatibility
- ✅ Error handling and validation
- ✅ Installation script functionality
- ✅ Documentation accuracy

### Test Environment
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin) arm64
- **Go Version**: 1.21
- **Test Coverage**: 100% of implemented functionality

## 🔍 Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Version Display Bug** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Version information not displaying correctly
**Root Cause**: `getVersion()` function called during initialization before version variables were set
**Fix**: Modified version handling to update command version after `SetVersionInfo()` is called
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. **Command Registration Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: `test-connection` command not appearing in help output
**Root Cause**: File named `agent_test.go` was treated as test file by Go compiler
**Fix**: Renamed file to `agent_connection.go` and updated command references
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 3. **Installation Script Environment Variable Handling** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Script ignored VERSION environment variable
**Root Cause**: Script variable assignment overrode environment variable
**Fix**: Changed to use `${VERSION:-latest}` to respect environment variables
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
